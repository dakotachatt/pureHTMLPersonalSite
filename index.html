    I have worked in the oil and gas industry for both large and small companies as a chemical engineer. I have been responsible for a variety of job scopes
    including field engineering and site supervision of tight shale drilling and completion operations, field HSE coaching and mentoring, annual budget
    estimation, performance analysis and I led the technical portion of contract development for the largest drilling and completions contract the
    Canadian Business Unit held, resulting in a savings of approximately $300,000 CAD per well.

  <p>
    While I have learned a lot through working in this industry and for these
    particular companies (both the large global and small local company cultures), I have always been interested in software development and until recently haven't
    been able to dedicate much time to it's pursuit. I also am looking to gain experience in a field that is largely industry independent.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have made a decision to go back to school for an Associates Degree in Software Development while dedicating the next two years of my life to immersing
    myself in both web development and object oriented programming (Java by school curriculum) through stuctured learning, as well as having time to create several
    personal projects to enhance my development. This is a huge change for me however with a very supportive family (with heavy emphasis on my wife),
    I feel that I am in a place to pursue this career change, and being 30 years old with 9 years total of engineering work experience I feel I can bring a unique
    perspective to the software development community.
